# ACCT420_Forecasting_and_Forensic_Analytics

This repository contains my __project__ for SMU module ACCT420 (Forecasting & Financial Analytics).

# Project description
This project aims to model accounting manipulation or fraud in __banks__. 

In this project, we work with transparently.AI, a company that provides AI-enabled accounting manipulation and fraud prediction. The problem at hand is that 40% of companies manipulate their accounts, and more than $1 trillion USD per year is lost to owners, investors, suppliers and customers due to accounting manipulation and fraud. Hence the need for a model that could predict manipulation and fraud.

## Methodology
Part 1 - Taxonomy research (understanding the use-case)

In this part, we look into cases of bank failures and the types of accounting manipulation/fraud that has led to these failures (eg. Lehman Brothers in 2008). Then, we compile the common features across these cases. Lastly, with the help of these common features, we come up with a list of variables that would help in modelling manipulation/fraud in banks.

Part 2 -  Modelling
